@article{Benosman12,
	abstract = {This paper introduces a process to compute optical flow using an asynchronous event-based retina at high speed and low computational load. A new generation of artificial vision sensors has now started to rely on biologically inspired designs for light acquisition. Biological retinas, and their artificial counterparts, are totally asynchronous and data driven and rely on a paradigm of light acquisition radically different from most of the currently used frame-grabber technologies. This paper introduces a framework for processing visual data using asynchronous event-based acquisition, providing a method for the evaluation of optical flow. The paper shows that current limitations of optical flow computation can be overcome by using event-based visual acquisition, where high data sparseness and high temporal resolution permit the computation of optical flow with micro-second accuracy and at very low computational cost.},

@article{Rasetto2022,
	abstract = {Neuromorphic engineering has led to the necessary process of rethinking of how we process and integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve computation and avoid the current high power and latency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hardware. Current neuromorphic processors are, however, limited by digital technologies, which cannot reproduce the abilities of biological neural computation in terms of power, latency and area cost. In this paper, we show that the combined use of the dynamic properties of memristors to implement a model of synaptic integration and the determination of the correct level of abstraction of biological neural networks has the potential to open a new range of capabilities for neuromorphic processors. We test this approach using a novel three-terminal LixWO3 electrochemical memristor, by deriving its conductance model and using it to emulate synaptic temporal kernel computation in the context of a pattern recognition task. We show that these devices allow for robust results with no loss in precision while opening the path for an energy efficient approach to build novel bio-inspired processing units in silicon.},

  abstract = {The timing of action potentials in sensory neurons contains substantial information about the eliciting stimuli. Although the computational advantages of spike timing\textendash based neuronal codes have long been recognized, it is unclear whether, and if so how, neurons can learn to read out such representations. We propose a new, biologically plausible supervised synaptic learning rule that enables neurons to efficiently learn a broad range of decision rules, even when information is embedded in the spatiotemporal structure of spike patterns rather than in mean firing rates. The number of categorizations of random spatiotemporal patterns that a neuron can implement is several times larger than the number of its synapses. The underlying nonlinear temporal computation allows neurons to access information beyond single-neuron statistics and to discriminate between inputs on the basis of multineuronal spike statistics. Our work demonstrates the high capacity of neural systems to learn to decode information embedded in distributed patterns of spike synchrony.},

@article{Lagorce17,
	abstract = {This paper describes novel event-based spatiotemporal features called time-surfaces and how they can be used to create a hierarchical event-based pattern recognition architecture. Unlike existing hierarchical architectures for pattern recognition, the presented model relies on a time oriented approach to extract spatio-temporal features from the asynchronously acquired dynamics of a visual scene. These dynamics are acquired using biologically inspired frameless asynchronous event-driven vision sensors. Similarly to cortical structures, subsequent layers in our hierarchy extract increasingly abstract features using increasingly large spatio-temporal windows. The central concept is to use the rich temporal information provided by events to create contexts in the form of time-surfaces which represent the recent temporal activity within a local spatial neighborhood. We demonstrate that this concept can robustly be used at all stages of an event-based hierarchical model. First layer feature units operate on groups of pixels, while subsequent layer feature units operate on the output of lower level feature units. We report results on a previously published 36 class character recognition task and a 4 class canonical dynamic card pip task, achieving near 100\% accuracy on each. We introduce a new 7 class moving face recognition task, achieving 79\% accuracy.},

@article{Grimaldi22pami,
	abstract = {We propose a neuromimetic architecture able to perform always-on pattern recognition. To achieve this, we extended an existing event-based algorithm [1], which introduced novel spatio-temporal features as a Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS). Built from asynchronous events acquired by a neuromorphic camera, these time surfaces allow to code the local dynamics of a visual scene and to create an efficient event-based pattern recognition architecture. Inspired by neuroscience, we extended this method to increase its performance. Our first contribution was to add a homeostatic gain control on the activity of neurons to improve the learning of spatio-temporal patterns [2]. A second contribution is to draw an analogy between the HOTS algorithm and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Following that analogy, our last contribution is to modify the classification layer and remodel the offline pattern categorization method previously used into an online and event-driven one. This classifier uses the spiking output of the network to define novel time surfaces and we then perform online classification with a neuromimetic implementation of a multinomial logistic regression. Not only do these improvements increase consistently the performances of the network, they also make this event-driven pattern recognition algorithm online and bio-realistic. Results were validated on different datasets: DVS barrel [3], Poker-DVS [4] and N-MNIST [5]. We foresee to develop the SNN version of the method and to extend this fully event-driven approach to more naturalistic tasks, notably for always-on, ultra-fast object categorization.},

@article{Izhikevich06,
	abstract = {We present a minimal spiking network that can polychronize, that is, exhibit reproducible time-locked but not synchronous firing patterns with millisecond precision, as in synfire braids. The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}); a ready-to-use {MATLAB} code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and {STDP}, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection ({TNGS}, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as ``attention to memories.''},
